  My academic interests are broad and in the past I have described myself as a bit of an academic 'magpie', however, I have published on topics such as migration and residential mobility (and particularly modelling migration using spatial interaction models), housing, gentrification, geographies of beer and brewing, synthetic data and longitudinal analysis.

  Tying all of these themes together is a focus on data and quantitative methods and a passion for applied work which often finds a home in urban settings.
