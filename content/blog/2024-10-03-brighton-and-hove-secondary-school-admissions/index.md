Here I'm going to write a few thoughts and observations about the newly proposed Brighton and Hove Secondary School Admissions Policy and proposed changes to the school catchment areas.

I'm going to do the best I can with the data and information available, but as I see it, there are issues with various elements of the different proposal options - to a greater or lesser degree.

All current information is available from here:

I'm going to start by looking at the current catchment areas and how they are proposed to change.
